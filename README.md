# WhatsApp-Data-Donation-Study
A Study by the Movey Lab at the Eramsus University Rotterdam that explores how Linguistic Similarity Affects Persuasive Message Preferences of Adolescents

### What did we do?
1. We collected a large writing sample from adolescents via the Data Donation platform PORT
2. We preprocessed the Chat Data (see, Notebook: *Data Donation Preparation*)
3. We caluclated Message Similarity Scores via the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tool (LIWC22, see Notebook: *LIWC Data Preparation*)
4. We gathered survey data from adolescents to assess their message preference in a survey experiment (see, Notebook: *Survey Data Preparation*)
5. We ran multiple Bayesian Mixed Effects Models in Bambi for our main analyses and three hypotheses (see, Notebook: *Bayesian Mixed Effect Analysis*)
